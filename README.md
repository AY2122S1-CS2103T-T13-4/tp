* This is **a sample project for Software Engineering (SE) students**.<br>
  Example usages:
  * as a starting point of a course project (as opposed to writing everything from scratch)
  * as a case study
* The project simulates an ongoing software project for a desktop application (called _CallMeMaybe_) used for managing contact details.
  * It is **written in OOP fashion**. It provides a **reasonably well-written** code base **bigger** (around 6 KLoC) than what students usually write in beginner-level SE modules, without being overwhelmingly big.
  * It comes with a **reasonable level of user and developer documentation**.
* It is named `CallMeMaybe` because it is for freelance telemarketers who have a huge list of people to call and need an easy to way to catalog the contacts.
* Check out the documentation at our [website](https://ay2122s1-cs2103t-t13-4.github.io/tp/)!
